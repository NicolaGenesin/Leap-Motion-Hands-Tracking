NOTE: You need Unity 3D Pro to run this

> 1. Clone it into local
> 2. Open from folder YourFolder\Leap_Motion-master\Assets\Scenes\Gestures

How to use it:

> 1. One finger = Camera move
> 2. 3 or more fingers with the other one hand = stop Camera move  (really usefull if you want to move over the scene)

If you want to pick up the sphere, just unCkick Camera Leap Script from MainCamera and activate Leap Manager into LeapController
